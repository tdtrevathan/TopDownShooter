# TopDownShooter
Top-Down Shooter level created in Unity using C#

The majority of the work in C# can be located in Assets/Scripts.

The purpose of this project was to gain experience in projects which contain code in multiple files
and ecorporate a multi-step design process.

This project was a part of a Udemy course which I followed and added my own twist on certain aspects. 
For example, I modified the code for the minion charachter in order to create a boss which had more complicated 
behavior patters and path movements.

The game contains a menu system, a player character, enemy characters, projectiles, sounds, sprites, 
and a loading screen. There is a scoring sytsem which maintains its value throughout the various game screnes.
